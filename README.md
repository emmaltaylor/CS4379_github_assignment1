This notebook should be run one cell at a time. 

I added a feature that checks for the movie era to see if it is recent, modern, vintage, or classic.

I included two analyses of the data; one analyzing the top countries that contribute to Netflix titles, and one analyzing the difference in eras between TV shows and movies.

My findings were that USA contributes the most to Netflix titles, and that movies and TV shows from the modern era are most prevalent in the data.
